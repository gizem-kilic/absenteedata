Data Summary

Data Source: It is an artificially generated HR Analytics data, generated by Lyndon Sundmark, who is a well-known author and data scientist in the field of HR Analytics. It is generated for the purpose of practice and learning, specifically for HR Analysts and for the purpose of learning to predict absence as an outcome. External Data. 

Data Collection: Fictitious data

The data set contains employee numbers and names, gender, city, job title, department, store location, business unit, division, age, length of service, and the number of hours absent.Absence is taken as the total annual absent hours per employee. The data is assumed for one year. 

Why this data set? 

I want to connect my previous professional experience as a recruiter to my data analysis studies and hopefully land a job in HR Analytics. Therefore, this data set and this analysis would make a great addition to my portfolio.
